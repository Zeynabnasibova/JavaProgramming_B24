        Java Infinite While Loop
To make a Java While Loop run indefinitely, the while condition has to be true forever. To make the condition always true, there are many ways. Some of these methods are:
Write boolean value true in place of while loop condition.
Or, write a while loop condition that always evaluates to true, something like 1==1.
Write a while loop condition such that the control variables in condition are never updated.
In this tutorial, we will write Java programs to create infinite while loop, using above methods.
Flowchart – Java Infinite While Loop
Following is the flowchart of infinite while loop in Java.
s the condition is never going to be false, the control never comes out of the loop, and forms an Infinite Loop as shown in the above diagram

        /*
        Example 1 – Java Infinite While Loop with True for Condition
Firstly, we know that the condition in while statement has to always evaluate to True for it to become infinite Loop. Secondly, we also know that the condition evaluates to a boolean value. So, considering these two statements, we can provide the boolean value true, in place of condition, and the result is a infinite while loop.

        while (true) {
            System.out.println("hello");
        }
        /*
        Note: You will see the string hello print to the console infinitely. If you are running from command prompt or terminal, to terminate the execution of the program, enter Ctrl+C from keyboard. If you are running the program from an IDE, click on the stop button provided by the IDE.
