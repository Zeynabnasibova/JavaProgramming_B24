Java provides three classes to represent a sequence of characters: String, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder. The String class is an immutable class whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes are mutable. There are many differences between StringBuffer and StringBuilder. The StringBuilder class is introduced since JDK 1.5.
StringBuffer is synchronized i.e. thread safe. It means two threads can't call the methods of StringBuffer simultaneously.
StringBuffer is less efficient than StringBuilder.
StringBuffer was introduced in Java 1.0

StringBuilder is non-synchronized i.e. not thread safe. It means two threads can call the methods of StringBuilder simultaneously.

StringBuilder is more efficient than StringBuffer.

StringBuilder was introduced in Java 1.5
